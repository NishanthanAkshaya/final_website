		<h2> The First Camera </h2>
		<p>
			Aristotle used the principles of a camera obscura in 4th century BC&sbquo; where an image is projected through a small hole. However&sbquo; a scientist named Alhazen (or Ibn al-Haytham) is said to have actually invented the camera obscura and pinole camera through his extensive study of how images are formed by light. Although the camera was revolutionary:

			On the other hand&sbquo; its size lead to many observatories being set up for groups to look at pictures through the camera and was later refined to add a lens to focus light and made smaller and more portable.

		<h2> Recording Images 
		<p>
			Joseph Nic&eacute;phore Ni&eacute;pce and  Louis Jacques Mand&eacute; Daguerre created the basis for the cameras we are familiar with today. Joseph Ni&eacute;pce experimented with silver chloride and silver halide but the recorded images darkened with light. In 1862&sbquo; he used a sheet of pewter coated with bitumen which needed to be exposed for 8 hours.

			Louis Daguerre&sbquo; a painter&sbquo; refined the image-creating process with silver-plate sheets of copper fumed with mercury vapor. By 1939&sbquo; Daguerre reduced exposure time to mere seconds sbco; which meant that this camera model was used for commercial portraits. Willam Henry Fox invented the calotype process a few years later&sbquo; allowing photographers to create negatives where multiple prints could be created. In 1851&sbquo; Frederick Scott Archer invented the collodion wet plate process, which created a negative image on a transparent glass plate and was used for tintype portraits until around the 1900s. The gelatin dry plate process was introduced in the late 1800s and was used more often afterwards.

		<h2>Shaping Modern-Day Photography</h2>

		<p>
			In 1889&sbquo; George Eastman created the roll of film&sbquo; allowing people to consecutively shoot multiple pictures. His company Kodak allowed snapshots to be made and there wasn&rsquo;t a need to individually process each picture. Thomas Edison added the 35mm format and Oskar Barnack introduced the compact Leica camera with 35 mm film.
		</p>
		<p class = "border" >
			Kodak then released Kodachrome with multiple layers that created colour film. When World War II started in 1939&sbquo; photojournalists used the new lens to capture the realities of war instead of creating staged pictures.
		</p>
		<h2>Refining the Camera</h2>
		<img class = "history" id = "floaty" src = "Photo.png" alt = "refine" height= "150px"/>
		<p>
			Around this time&sbquo; Polaroid introduced instant images&sbquo; but stopped producing their instant film in 2008. Asahi (later Pentax) introduced the Asahiflex and Nikon introduced the Nikon F camera&sbquo; which are SLR cameras&sbquo; in the 1950s. SLR cameras are single-lens reflex cameras that use a mirror and prism system so that the user can see what they&rsquo;re going to take a picture of. This allowed interchangeable lenses and other customizations to be made.
		</p>
		<p class = "border">
			From the 1950s to the early &lsquo;80s&sbquo; cameras that could calculate shutter speed&sbquo; aperture&sbquo; and focus were created and what was considered the first self-contained digital camera was made by Kodak in 1975. By 1991&sbquo; Kodak created the first fully digital camera that was good enough for professional use and other manufacturers started introducing advanced digital(DSLR) cameras.
