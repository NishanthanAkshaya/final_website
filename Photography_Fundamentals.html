		<h2> Exposure Triangle </h2>
		<p> One of the most important parts of photography is exposure&sbquo; as the whole concept of photography is built around light. You'll see just how important light is if you look at the history of photography <p>
		<p> Exposure is the control of brightness or darkness. Many photographers feel a lack of consistency with exposure when taking pictures, but through understanding the 3 factors that affect exposure, this can be reduced </p>
		<h3>ISO(Used to be called ASA)</h3>
		<p> ISO is how sensitive the camera sensor is to light. The higher the ISO&sbquo; the more light it picks up. However&sbquo; too much ISO is noise and adds a sketchy feel and unnecessary extra light </p>
		<h3>Shutter Speed</h3>
		<p>
			Shutter speed is how long the shutter is open. Fast is 1 out of 1000 of a second&sbquo; and slow could be 20 minutes. If there is a lower shutter speed&sbquo; more light is sensed. Blurring things can show movement in an image&sbquo; and can be done with a slow shutter speed. It is better to do 1 out of 250 to eliminate your own hand shaking or use a tripod device to keep it steady.
		</p>
		<h3>Aperture</h3>
		<p>
			Aperture is the amount of light a lens lets through to hit a sensor. If the lense is wide&sbquo; there is more light. However&sbquo; the number will be lower. It also controls depth of field or sharpness. A large number means that not a lot of light comes through, but everything in frame(background and foreground) is clear, while small numbers mean that a lot of light comes in&sbquo; but only a specific focus point. Around F16-32 is used by landscape photographers because a lot in the frame is clear&sbquo; even if there may not be a lot of light. Aperture is also called F-stop.
		</p>
		<p> The light meter automatically changes one&sbquo; two&sbquo; or all of the exposure settings to get a properly exposed photo in automatic mode. In manual mode&sbquo; it will simply guide the photographer </p>
		<h3>Composition </h3>
		<p> There are many different types of composition grids and styles&sbquo; like the rule of thirds&sbquo; where the subject is in one axis/intersection of the grid&sbquo; not in the center. However&sbquo; composition is more than just grids. </p>
		<p> Here are some tips for composition: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Try the same shot from different angles</li>
			<li>Look at all elements in the frame </li>
			<li>Choose between landscape and portrait</li>
			<li>Learn to translate our 3d vision into what the 2d picture will look like</li>
			<li>Colour, contrast and balance are also of equal importance to grids for composition </li>
			<li>Think of abstract colours and forms</li>
			<li>Think of negative space</li>
			<li> Angles are important&sbquo; as a higher angle can make someone feel detached or as if they were ruling over the subject&sbquo; while eyelevel makes the viewer more involved with the picture&sbquo; and lowshot gives the subject of the photo more power </li>
