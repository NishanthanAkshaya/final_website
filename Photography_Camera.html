		<p> In this page, you'll learn briefly about the parts of a camera. </p> </h2> <!--4 pages -->
		<h2> Outer Parts </h2>
		<p>Body &rarr; Everything except the lens. The feel of the camera can be a determining factor on purchasing a camera </p>
		<p>Lens &rarr; Most beginners use the kit lens that goes from wide-range to mid-range. You can get prime lenses for portrait photography that create blurry backgrounds. Not all lenses are interchangeable.</p>
		<p>ViewFinder &rarr; Tiny box where you see the picture you’re going to take and some basic info on the settings applied to the picture. Mirrorless cameras have an electronic VF.</p>
		<p>Sensor &rarr; Picks up light and is essential for exposure</p>
		<p>Aperture &rarr; Ring inside the lens that expands and contracts to take pictures. It’s also an essential part of exposure in a photo.</p>
		<p>Playback button &rarr; Shows the image(s) you took</p>
		<p>Shutter Button &rarr; Opens and closes the shutter, taking a picture. It is usually at the top</p>
		<p>LCD screen &rarr; Where you can see the picture you just took or settings, but modern camera screens act like the Viewfinder and can be an alternative for it. Some also swivel around for more accessibility in cramped positions.</p>
		<p>Hotshoe &rarr; Metal piece usually at the top of DSLR cameras for accessories like the flash. Compact cameras may have a coldshoe, where there isn’t anything to transfer the signal from the camera to accessories, so hotshoes are more effective.</p>
		<p>Lens Hood&rarr; Protects lens from accidents or flaring, but not all lenses have them.</p>
		<p>Flash &rarr; Adds more light and digital cameras often have in-built flashes. However, it can overexpose the image or wash out the colorrs. </p>
		<p>Flang &rarr; Hole connecting lens to camera body and only found on cameras with interchangeable lenses. </p>
		<p>Memory card &rarr; where photos are saved. </p>
		<p>Micro Card Slot &rarr; Different slots for various memory cards, like Micro SD, SD, or CF cards, and on the side of the camera. </p>
		<p>AF/MF switch &rarr; Most modern camera lenses have a switch for automatic(AF) or manual(MF) focus. </p>
		<p>Focus ring &rarr; Controls where the focal point is in manual focus mode and is around the top of the lense</p>
		<p>Zoom Ring &rarr; Closer to the camera body and controls zoom. </p>
		<p>Baseplate Receiver &rarr; Circular part around ¼ inch at the bottom of the camera used to attach a tripod. </p>
		<p>Diopter &rarr; Only in some cameras and near the viewfinder so that the image you see is clear when you look through the small area of the viewfinder. </p>
		<p>User controls &rarr; Settings that can be in different places, but usually around the top and near the shutter button. </p>
		<p>Camera Straps: To loop around your neck and easily carry the camera safely. </p>
		<p>Auxiliary Inputs &rarr; On most digital cameras, opposite to the sd card holder are some inputs for things like microphone or hdmi inputs. </p>
